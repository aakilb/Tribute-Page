  <h3 id="tribute-info">Here is a timeline of Mahatma Gandhi's life:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>October 2, 1869: </strong>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is born in Porbandar, in western India.</li>
    <li><strong>May 1883: </strong>Gandhi gets married to Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia.</li>
    <li><strong>1888 - 1891: </strong>Gandhi studies law in London. He is introduced to the Bible and to the Bhagavadgita, which he reads for the first time in its English translation by Sir Edwin Arnold.</li>
    <li><strong>1893 - 1894: </strong>Gandhi takes a job with an Indian law firm in South Africa, where he is quickly exposed to the racial discrimination practiced there. He settles in Durban and begins to practice law. In 1894 he founds the Natal Indian Congress to agitate for Indian rights. Through that political organization he infuses a spirit of solidarity in the heterogeneous Indian community. He floods the government, the legislature, and the press with closely reasoned statements of Indian grievances.</li>
    <li><strong>1906 - 1915: </strong>A discriminatory law is passed in the Transvaal region of South Africa forcing all Indians to register with the provincial government or else face punishment. Under Gandhi’s leadership the Indian community takes a pledge to defy the law and to suffer all the penalties resulting from its defiance. This practice becomes known as satyagraha, a technique for redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting, suffering, for resisting adversaries without rancor, and fighting them without violence.</li>
    <li><strong>1919- 1924: </strong>Gandhi becomes a leader in the Indian National Congress political party. He campaigns for swaraj, or “self-rule.” He works to reconcile all classes and religious sects, especially Hindus and Muslims.In 1920 he launches a noncooperation campaign against Britain, urging Indians to spin their own cotton and to boycott British goods, courts, and government. This leads to his imprisonment from 1922 to 1924.</li>
    <li><strong>1930 - 1931: </strong>Gandhi leads tens of thousands of Indians on a 385-kilometer march to the sea to collect their own salt. The march is a protest against a British tax on salt and results in 60,000 people being arrested. In 1931 the British viceroy and Gandhi sign an agreement (the Gandhi-Irwin Pact) marking the end of a period of civil disobedience in India against British rule. The pact involves Gandhi pledging to give up the satyagraha campaign and the British viceroy agreeing to release all those who had been imprisoned and to allow Indians to make salt for domestic use.</li>
    <li><strong>1932: </strong>Under a new viceroy, Gandhi is imprisoned again. While in prison he fasts to protest the British decision to segregate the so-called untouchables (the lowest level of the Indian caste system) by allotting them separate electorates in the new constitution. The fast causes an emotional upheaval in the country, and the British agree to change the policy.</li>
    <li><strong>1942 - 1944: </strong>Gandhi, who in 1934 had resigned as leader and member of the Indian National Congress, becomes politically active again early in World War II, demanding immediate independence as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war. He is imprisoned again, from 1942 to 1944.</li>
    <li><strong>August 15, 1947: </strong>India formally achieves independence from British rule. However, the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan is a great disappointment to Gandhi, who has long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. Rioting between Muslims and Hindus over the partition breaks out in many areas. Again Gandhi turns to nonviolence, fasting until Delhi rioters pledge peace.</li>
    <li><strong>January 30, 1948: </strong>While on his way to prayer in Delhi, Gandhi is killed by Nathuram Vinayak Godse who has been angered by Gandhi’s efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims.</li>
  </ul>
